   * Computes the forward pass for a 2D spatial convolutional layer with
   * F filters.  The input data has N examples, each represented as a 3D
   * volume unrolled into a single vector.
   *
   * This implementation uses `im2col` internally for each image to
   * extract local image regions (patches) into columns, and then
   * performs a matrix multiplication with the filters to compute the
   * output maps.
   *
   * Inputs:
   *  - X: Input data matrix, of shape (N, C*Hin*Win).
   *  - W: Weights (parameters) matrix, of shape (F, C*Hf*Wf).
   *  - b: Biases vector, of shape (F, 1).
   *  - C: Number of input channels (dimensionality of input depth).
   *  - Hin: Input height.
   *  - Win: Input width.
   *  - Hf: Filter height.
   *  - Wf: Filter width.
   *  - strideh: Stride over height.
   *  - stridew: Stride over width.
   *  - padh: Padding for top and bottom sides.
   *      For same output height as input, set padh = (Hf - 1) / 2,
   *      assuming strideh = 1.
   *      More generally, padh = (Hin*(strideh-1) + Hf - strideh) / 2
   *      preserves the spatial dimensions of the input.
   *  - padw: Padding for left and right sides.
   *      For same output width as input, set padw = (Wf - 1) / 2,
   *      assuming stridew = 1.
   *      More generally, padw = (Win*(stridew-1) + Wf - stridew) / 2
   *      preserves the spatial dimensions of the input.
   *
   * Outputs:
   *  - out: Outputs, of shape (N, F*Hout*Wout).
   *  - Hout: Output height.
   *  - Wout: Output width.
