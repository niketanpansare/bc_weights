   * Performs an SGD update with Nesterov momentum.
   *
   * As with regular SGD with momentum, in SGD with Nesterov momentum,
   * we assume that the parameters have a velocity that continues
   * with some momentum, and that is influenced by the gradient.
   * In this view specifically, we perform the position update from the
   * position that the momentum is about to carry the parameters to,
   * rather than from the previous position.  Additionally, we always
   * store the parameters in their position after momentum.
   *

   *  - Advances in optimizing Recurrent Networks, Bengio et al., section 3.5.

   *
   * Inputs:
   *  - X: Parameters to update, of shape (any, any).
   *  - dX: Gradient of X wrt to a loss function being optimized, of
   *      same shape as X.
   *  - lr: Learning rate.
   *  - mu: Momentum value.
   *      Typical values are in the range of [0.5, 0.99], usually
   *      started at the lower end and annealed towards the higher end.
   *  - v: State maintaining the velocity of the parameters X, of same
   *      shape as X.
   *
   * Outputs:
   *  - X: Updated parameters X, of same shape as input X.
   *  - v: Updated velocity of the parameters X, of same shape as
   *      input v.
