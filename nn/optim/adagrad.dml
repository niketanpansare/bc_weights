   * This is an adaptive learning rate optimizer that maintains the

   * learning rate.

   *      - http://jmlr.org/papers/v12/duchi11a.html

   * Inputs:
   *  - X: Parameters to update, of shape (any, any).
   *  - dX: Gradient of X wrt to a loss function being optimized, of
   *      same shape as X.
   *  - lr: Learning rate.
   *  - epsilon: Smoothing term to avoid divide by zero errors.
   *      Typical values are in the range of [1e-8, 1e-4].
   *  - cache: State that maintains per-parameter sum of squared
   *      gradients, of same shape as X.
   *
   * Outputs:
   *  - X: Updated parameters X, of same shape as input X.
   *  - v: Updated velocity of the parameters X, of same shape as
   *      input v.
